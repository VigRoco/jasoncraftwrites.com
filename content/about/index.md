## About Me
I grew up in the Deep South with stories filling my head of places other than my home state of Louisiana. After surviving the typical, American middle-class adolecent experience, I grew up to be a halfway-decent software engineer. Eventually, I moved out of Louisiana up to Seattle, Washington where I now reside with my wife and our two cats. Now that I'm legally classified as an adult, I write these stories that have followed me throughout my life.
