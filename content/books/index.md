### Shadeskin

Lurking beneath the veil of reality, a supernatural war
threatens to consume the city of Shreveport, Louisiana.
The Illumin, messengers of light, strive to protect the city's
human inhabitants from the vicious Shades. Banished
from their natural world, the Shades carve out a restless
existence among us. The powerful Raven family stands
between the warring Shades and Illumin, struggling to
maintain a delicate balance while ensuring that everyone
else remains unaware.

In the nearby town of Wheelbarrow Creek, an Aztec relic
makes its way into Matthew Gillard’s hands, unlocking an
evil with the power to bring back the dead. Impossible to
control, the relic bends him to its will. Now Raven, Shade,
and Illumin hunt after this newfound threat.
