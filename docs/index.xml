      <description>I publish speculative fiction titles that you can purchase online, should you wish to encourage my writing habit. All of my digital works are available from the Kindle store. Check out my author page for easy access. My print works are available from either the Amazon or Barnes &amp;amp; Noble stores.
Supremcy: Reformation Cast down and imprisoned in the age past, the gods left their creation to survive without guidance. Two brothers now struggle to unite the last of the ancient Orders.</description>

      <description>About Me I grew up in the Deep South with stories filling my head of places other than my home state of Louisiana. After surviving the typical, American middle-class adolecent experience, I grew up to be a halfway-decent software engineer.

Now that I&amp;rsquo;m legally classified as an adult, I write these stories that have followed me throughout my life.</description>
